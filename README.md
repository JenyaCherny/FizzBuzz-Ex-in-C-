# FizzBuzz-Ex-in-C-
Create a collection of ints from 1-100.
Loop over each int in the collection. If the number is even then print to console the number followed by "Is Even"
If the number is divisible by 5, then print to console the number followed by "Is Divisible by 5"
If it is divisible by 2 and 5 then print to console the number followed by "the number is divisible by 2 and 5"
After the looping, have a Console.ReadLine so the program does not exit and you can examine the text. 
I decided to change ReadLine to ReadKey.
